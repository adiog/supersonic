Introducing Supersonic Query Engine
===================================

Monday, October 15, 2012

We are happy to announce the open source release of Supersonic, a query engine library, that is extremely useful for creating a column oriented database back-end.

Supersonicâ€™s main strength lies in its speed. It is a cache-aware engine which exploits several low-level optimization techniques to ensure second-to-none execution times and high throughput. By making use of SIMD instructions and efficient pipelining we make columnar data processing very fast.

The engine supports a wide variety of typical columnar operations as well as many other specialized functionalities. We believe it to be a useful tool for those of you working on new DBMS solutions to help handle your data more effectively.
